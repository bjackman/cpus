# EVERY CPU EVER IN A PERFECT BEAUTIFUL DATABASE

This was my brief attempt to scrape something useful out of the crappy .csv
files that Intel and AMD provide on their websites and then join them against a
table of which models have which microarchitecture.

Don't worry we did not forget any CPUs, we got both kinds here.

I think this would basically work, just needs a few hours of grind to get more
data and clean up what we have.

(Later) - I spend a couple more hours fiddling around with this thinking it
would be fun to learn Polars. But, it wasn't fun. So right now I think this is
currently broken.
